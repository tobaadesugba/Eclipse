# Eclipse Job Ad Generator
This project generates job ads for various job titles using OpenAI's GPT large language model and deploys them on the Streamlit platform. It uses object-oriented programming to handle errors and ensure a smooth user experience.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine and install the required dependencies by running:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
After installing the dependencies, change the API key in the XXX python script and run the Streamlit app by running:

```
streamlit run app.py
```
The app will open in your default browser, and you can begin generating job ads by inputting a job title.

##  Usage
To generate job ads, simply input a job title into the app and click the "Generate" button. The GPT language model will generate a job ad based on the inputted job title, which will be displayed in the app.
